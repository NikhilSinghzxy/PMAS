# Usecase Diagram

![](Usecase_diagram.png)

### Aim of the Use Case Diagram (Predictive Maintenance System):

To illustrate how different users interact with the Predictive Maintenance Automation System to monitor machine health, collect and analyze sensor data, predict failures, detect anomalies, generate alerts, and manage maintenance activities efficiently—thereby reducing downtime, preventing unexpected failures, and optimizing maintenance operations.

## 1. Actors

### 1.1 Human Actors

- **User**  
  Responsible for monitoring machine health and viewing alerts generated by the system.

- **Technician**  
  Responsible for logging into the system, managing machines, monitoring equipment health, and creating maintenance tickets.

- **System Administrator**  
  Manages user access, registers technicians, manages machines, and views or updates maintenance tickets to ensure smooth system operation.

---

### 1.2 External System Actors

- **System (Predictive Maintenance Automation System)**  
  Performs automated operations such as collecting sensor data, preprocessing data, analyzing machine health, detecting anomalies, predicting failure risks, and generating alerts.

- **Sensor Data Source**  
  Provides real-time and historical sensor data from machines to the system.

- **Predictive Analysis Engine**  
  Assists in data preprocessing, anomaly detection, and failure risk prediction.

- **Alert Notification System**  
  Sends alerts through email, SMS, or messaging platforms.
